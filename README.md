# kf_watermarker
A small Golang script to watermark any video you want to upload to KF so Turkey Tom can't cuck you while you sit in the corner

You can either build it from sauce with: ```go build -o kf_watermarker.exe main.go``` (Windows) or ```go build -o kf_watermarker main.go``` (Lincucks)
Or you can just be a lazy chad and fetch the binary from the releases tab if you trust me enough, if you don't then you can view the sauce yourself, it's pretty shrimple
